Created Date: 2/24/2017

The purpose of this project is to process sales file for Staten Island. It does the following:

1. Clean up of sales file to keep only actual sales. In this process, remove impossible sale data, such as those with sale price <= $5. Those would mostly be outliers.
2. Scatter plot of 1, 2 and 3 family homes priced less than 100000
3. 5 number summary of 1, 2 and 3 family homes priced less than 100000
4. Scatter plot of the sales data after outliers are removed.

The project is organized into the following directories:
- Data directory    : contains files to load in and clean up data
- Analysis directory: contains files for exploratory data analysis
- Paper directory   : contains files with explanations on the data patterns
